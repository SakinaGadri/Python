# Python Exploration Project

I learnt Python in my first year of university. I learnt concepts such as Classes, UML, Inheritance, Linked Lists and Trees (Heaps and Binary Trees specifically).

Python has been one of the most easiest languages that I have learnt. As one of my TA's said, "Writing code in Python is similar to writing pseudocode, or better yet, writing English with a little bit of Math here and there"

In this project, I explored the syntax of Python (and that's where I was going to end, but found out that there's more to Python and Computer Science than just syntax). After familiarizing myself with syntax, I went on and looked at different ways to problem solve. I learnt recursion (in-depth this time), about different ways of storing data (Linked Lists, Binary Trees and Heaps) and about classes and inheritances. 

All in all, it was one of my favourite projects to do. I learnt a lot using Python, and this was more than just writing syntax.
10/10 would reccomend learning Python.
